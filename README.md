MOSS
Moss (for a Measure Of Software Similarity) is an automatic system for determining the similarity of programs. To date, the main application of Moss has been in detecting plagiarism in programming classes.

As CL you will be asked to use MOSS to detect plagiarism in student submissions. You will need to understand MOSS well enough to use it as well as to explain what it is, how it works, and why we use it to the 155A students. You will be asked to present this information to the class around week 5. A past CL, Jacob Harvey, provided a GitHub repository with notes on what to cover during this presentation including how MOSS works, what counts as cheating, and what students should do if they have been flagged for academic dishonesty (Harvey, 2022). Additionally, you can find a link to a Google Slides presentation based on Harveyâ€™s notes below, that can be used as a visual aid during your MOSS presentation.

Grading
You will be responsible for determining how to distribute the grading amongst the Learning Assistants. Additionally, you must decide whether or not to include yourself in the distribution. Ideally you will have time to grade and hold office hours; however, you may need to choose one or the other. For Course Leaders, I personally recommend prioritizing grading, and forgoing office hours if you must.
Distribution
The code I used to generate grading distributions is hosted on a GitHub repo linked below (Laube, 2024b.).
